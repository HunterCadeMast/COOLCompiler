# COOLCompiler

This is my full compiler for the COOL coding language from my 'Compiler Construction' course at Vanderbilt University. In this repo, there are different python scripts for each part of a compiler along with a 'readme' describing the code in each of them. Right now, they do not all fit together. They are just the raw files from each each assignment from the class. You should be able to throw a file into each part though and it should print out results.
